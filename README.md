# Potato Disease Classification

A Machine Learning project to classify potato leaf diseases into three categories:  
- Healthy  
- Late Blight  
- Early Blight  

The model is built using Keras and deployed via a FastAPI backend. A React frontend allows users to upload images and get disease predictions with accuracy details.

## Features

- Predict potato leaf disease from an image.  
- Trained CNN deep learning model using Keras.  
- REST API built with FastAPI to serve predictions.  
- React frontend to upload images and display results.

## Project Structure

- `Store-Model/` — Saved Keras model files.  
- `API/` — FastAPI application for serving prediction API.  
- `client/` — React app for user interaction.  
- `Train-Model/` — Model training files and scripts.
